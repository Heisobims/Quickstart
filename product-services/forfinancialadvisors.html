    <h1>Portfolio Management For Financial Advisors</h1>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="page-body">
    <div class="page-body-content">
        <h1>Quickstart believes the most successful advisor-client relationship is built on trust and expertise.</h1>

<p>Are you a financial advisor seeking a smarter, simpler way to expand your business and drive your clients' goals? Even the most skilled professionals can benefit from a collaborative relationship with a fellow expert in their field, which is precisely what our Portfolio Management services for financial advisors can offer you.</p>

<p>Quickstart Capital Management partners with financial advisors ready to maximize their success and streamline their efforts. You can leverage our extensive experience, diversity of investment strategies, and time to gain the freedom to go beyond what was possible when you were working alone.</p>

<h3>How Portfolio Management Can Benefit Your Business Goals</h3>

<p>Financial advisors who work with Quickstart get to experience more time focusing on their client relationships while leaving the investment management and back-office&nbsp;operations to us.</p>

<p><a href="/whychooseus.html">Financial advisory firms</a> are increasingly finding that by using third-party asset management expertise, they can streamline their product offerings to be more efficient while still providing the valuable services their clients require. Outsourcing allows financial advisors the ability to leverage the breadth of investment strategies offered by the third-party asset management firm, as well as the enhanced due diligence and monitoring compliance under which the investment managers operate. The clients benefit from this partnership, as they can trust that the <a href="../#ourteam">third-party managers</a> reflect the same or higher standards of service that they have come to rely on with their financial advisor.</p>

<p>Many advisers also seek third-party portfolio management to gain access to alternative investments or smart beta investments. They also seek expertise in emerging or frontier markets and environmental, social, and governance investments, also known as ESG. Others want to remove compliance burdens or free up time for business development.</p>

<p>Third-party asset management also provides:</p>

<p>Portfolio guidance based on sound, proven investment philosophy</p>
<p>Complete portfolio structures designed for a wide variety of client needs</p>
<p>Custom portfolio management for clients with unique needs and financial goals, including high-net-worth investors</p>

<h3>MANAGED PORTFOLIOS</h3>

<p>With 15+ portfolios based on income, total return, tax awareness, and active or passive management, there is a solution that fits your clients’ needs.</p>

<p>Financial advisory firms are entrusting up to 57% of client assets to third-party managers, an increase of over half from four years ago. A recent study shows that outsourcing provides numerous benefits, as confirmed by financial advisors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased growth in managed assets</li>
	<li>Higher personal income</li>
	<li>Lower operating costs</li>
	<li>Increase in the number of new clients</li>
	<li>Improved client retention</li>
	<li>Higher number of client referrals</li>
	<li>Increased client engagement</li>
	<li>Decreased back-office investment</li>
	<li>Greater flexibility</li>
	<li>Increased credibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Increased Growth and Lower Costs</h3>

<p>On average, advisors experience growth in total assets, increased personal income, and improved operating costs when working with a third-party asset manager. Not only did the financial advisors achieve growth and lower costs overall, but the impact grew with the number of assets outsourced.</p>

<p><a href="/whychooseus.html">In-house portfolio management</a> comes at the cost of time and operational investment like back-office operations and technology. Additionally, a study by SEI Advisor Network found that financial advisors who outsourced asset management increased their assets under management (AUM) by an average of $4.5 million, and added 14 new clients annually.</p>

<h3>Improved Relationships and Client Engagement&nbsp;</h3>

<p><br>
With the recovered time from outsourcing portfolio management, advisors can focus more on client relationships. They have more time to personalize their services to meet the diverse needs of their client base, ensuring that their overall financial services requirements are being met. The better the trust relationship, the more engaged clients are in planning their financial future. Clients who are actively engaged in their financial planning have a greater level of satisfaction with their advisors.</p>

<h3>Increased Credibility and Flexibility</h3>

<p>For smaller or newly established firms, outsourcing may help to enhance your credibility. By working with a third-party manager, you maintain objectivity, avoiding any potential conflicts of interest from creating financial plans, and making the investments. Focusing on financial planning and outsourcing portfolio management services also provides the flexibility to scale your business, making it more attractive to potential buyers if you decide to sell.</p>

<h3>CUSTOMIZATION</h3>

<p>Advisors can utilize Quickstart’s platform to implement many different types of strategies and account structures.</p>

<p>Quickstart can assist you in the design and management of qualified retirement plans. We’re more than just a portfolio manager.</p>
