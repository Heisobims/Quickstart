        <h1>Investment Management</h1>
        <p>Quickstart Capital  is committed to providing the highest level of investment advice and financial planning to our clients. As an Independent, fee-only Registered Investment Advisor, it is our mission to lead our clients to financial success. Through a disciplined and thorough process, we help our clients clearly define what “financial success” means to them and create a plan to achieve it. </p>
        <h3>What Does an Investment Manager Do?</h3>
        <p>An investment manager provides investment portfolio oversight for their clients. Based on your goals, risk profile, and other factors, the investment manager develops a strategy that determines the portfolio's right blend of stocks and bonds. He or she then monitors, buys, and sells the investments to optimize the returns while simultaneously minimizing risk. </p>
        <h3>How Do Investment Management Services Work?</h3>
        <p>When you choose an investment management firm, they will have a custodian they use for the trades. If you have IRAs, 401k plans, stocks, or bonds at other financial firms, getting those transferred is one of the services offered by an investment manager. One of the most valuable benefits of investment management services is the wealth of knowledge that is available for your benefit. Market analysis, tax planning, and risk mitigation strategies, as well as the insight into how historical performance can affect future opportunities, are all types of expertise that most investors do not have on their own.</p>
        <h3>When to Hire an Investment Manager</h3>
        <p>As most adults invest in retirement accounts or experiment with trading, they accumulate different types of investment vehicles. It can be challenging to get a cohesive, consolidated view of your performance across different brokerage firms. It is also not conducive to a holistic investment strategy. Choosing an investment manager gives you the benefit of having your accounts consolidated in one place with an expert who understands your financial goals to manage their performance. 

<br/>Even if you do not have multiple accounts, you can benefit from hiring an investment manager:<br/>

<br/>- Growing your financial assets
<br/>- Planning for family growth
<br/>- Planning for your retirement
<br/>- Managing inheritances
<br/>- Strategic trades to optimize tax planning
<br/>- Taking a defensive strategy to minimize losses during downturns</p>

<h1>Financial Planning</h1>        
<h3>What is Financial Planning?</h3>
        <p>Financial planning is a birds-eye view of your financial picture. As time goes on, your needs may change dramatically. A financial planner can help you set goals and prepare for life changes so that you are in a stable position to weather both good times and challenging ones. Financial planning services incorporate other areas of your financial picture, like taxes, estate planning, insurance, and cash-flow management.</p>

        <h1>Types of Financial Planning</h1>
        <p>Financial planning can include, but aren't limited to, the following:<br/>

<br/>- Budgeting
<br/>- Education funding planning
<br/>- Estate planning
<br/>- Insurance planning
<br/>- Investment planning
<br/>- Philanthropic planning
<br/>- Retirement planning
<br/>- Tax planning
<br/>- Debt planning</p>

<h1>Financial “Concierge” Consulting</h1>
<p>Financial concierge services essentially mean extra services. Just as you would ask questions about local landmarks, restaurant recommendations, or tickets to popular shows or activities at the concierge desk in your hotel, you can go to your financial concierge for all things pertaining to your finances. </p>
<h3>What is a Financial Concierge?</h3>
<p>A financial concierge is similar to a personal financial assistant. They provide extra services like reviewing documents or contracts, attending meetings with attorneys or accountants, communicating with financial institutions, or helping to find qualified experts for valuations, mortgages, or insurance. If you have an unexpected problem, they can likely find a way to solve it. A financial concierge provides a higher value of interaction, customized for your individual needs.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Having a Financial Concierge</h3>
<p>You can't be an expert in everything. That's why you can benefit from the education, experience, resources, and qualifications of a financial concierge. Some of the advantages include:<br/>

<br/>- Anticipating future needs
<br/>-Asking questions that you may not know to ask
<br/>-Preparing you for the next phase of your life, like starting a family or planning for retirement
<br/>-Keeping an eye on the economic horizon so that you can plan a defensive strategy
<br/>-Taking care of financial tasks and details that you don't have time to addres
<p>At Quickstart Capital Management, we are focused on your financial success. Whether you are just starting out in life and need guidance establishing your financial roadmap, are a high-net-worth investor in need of wealth management, or you need advice on how to grow your retirement funds, our team of expert wealth managers is here for you.
